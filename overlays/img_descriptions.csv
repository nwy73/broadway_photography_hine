1. Bowling Green in the days of old ‘Steamship Row’.  From an upper window at Morris Street. 1899.,"Built in 1815, the row of six houses at the foot of Broadway stand on the site of the short-lived presidential mansion, and before that Fort Amsterdam.  Known originally as “Quality Row,” their elite residents included a young Julia Ward Howe, future author of Battle Hymn of the Republic. By the 1850s, the houses were converted into the offices of foreign steamship companies, where customers came to purchase tickets for passage to European or other ports.
Despite “opposition and litigation,” Steamship Row was demolished within months of this photograph.  The new Custom House that rose in its place completed Bowling Green’s transformation into a citadel of American commercial power, enclosed by an imposing, almost continuous wall of stone.",1
"2. Stevens House, S.W. cor. B. and Morris Street. Once the site of the dwelling of Domine Megapolensis. 1905","Johannes Megapolensis, purportedly the first Protestant missionary to Native Americans, lived in a brick house on this corner while serving as chief minister of the Dutch church in New Amsterdam.  He complained about the numerous taverns that had by then opened on or near Broadway.
The construction in 1846 of the luxury Delmonico Hotel on this site would surely have caused Megapolensis to turn in his grave.  The Delmonico brothers introduced New Yorkers to European dining and fine wines.  When they moved uptown a decade later, the hotel was rechristened Stevens House, after the steamboat pioneer John Stevens, another former resident of this block.",2
"3. No. 48.  The humble 4 story brownstone, which has no doubt passed from being the home of wealth to the boarding house and so on down to the saloon.","Dwarfed by its neighbors – particularly the eleven-story Tower Building on the left, celebrated as the first skeleton-frame skyscraper – this brownstone’s days must have seemed numbered.   Hine’s caption adds a note of pathos by speculating, inaccurately, about its social decline – an implicit and common complaint about the takeover of lower Manhattan by working-class immigrants.
In this case, however, the skyscraper did not outlive the brownstone.  As Hine noted, “both are to come down shortly that a greater may reign in their stead.”   With land values on Broadway rising rapidly, the Tower Building’s tax assessment had outstripped the income it could yield through rent.",3
4. Trinity and the new Trinity Building,"Constructed in 1846, Trinity’s spire had crowned the New York skyline for over fifty years, visible even from Hine’s childhood home in Newark.  Overlooking Wall Street, it seemed to serve as a warning to speculators. But by 1905, it was overshadowed by skyscrapers, including the Empire Building (left) and the Trinity Building (right).
In any case, the idea of Trinity Church as a moral counterbalance to commerce had grown untenable. An 1895 report from the Tenement House Committee revealed the wealthy parish to be a major slumlord, indifferent to the squalid conditions in the three hundred tenements on its property. Meanwhile, the neo-Gothic trimmings of Trinity’s neighbors persuaded “City Beautiful” reformers that skyscrapers need not be expressions of competitive individualism, but could embody civic community.",4
"5. Monument to the Heroes of the Civil War.  Said to have been erected by the Trinity Corporation in order to prevent the City from putting Pine Street through the Church-yard, west from Broadway","Erected in Trinity churchyard in 1852, the Martyrs Monument was the city’s first not dedicated to a single individual. It memorialized the Patriot prisoners-of-war allegedly deposited here in unmarked graves after dying two blocks to the north, in the Old (Livingston) Sugar House.
As Hine noted, Trinity was suspected of an ulterior motive in erecting this monument: to block a street extension.  Democrats demanded its destruction or relocation in the name of “commercial progress” and the “public good,” while Whigs cast Trinity as the patriotic defender of “sacred ground” against landowners seeking to profit from a street opening.  Underlying the rhetoric was a shared anxiety about the “dangerous classes” west of this churchyard.",5
6. S.E. cor. of John Street. The ‘dead line’ below which no known crook is allowed to roam unmolested,"In 1880, Inspector Thomas F. Byrnes took action to safeguard bank vaults and jewelry stores in the financial district – a service for which, he later confessed, he was richly compensated.  Any convicted criminal who crossed the line of Fulton Street (a block north of here) could be arrested on sight.  Similar lines were drawn elsewhere in the city, creating “frozen zones” where police could act with impunity.
Although this “dead line” remained in force, the decade after 1905 saw a spate of heists. One detective blamed the subway, which allowed thieves to “ride to Wall Street and work their way back to Maiden Lane.”",6
7. The west cross-walk at Fulton Street,"This intersection – New York’s most crowded by the mid-nineteenth century – was once spanned by an ornate cast-iron footbridge named after city comptroller Charles Loew.  Built at great expense in 1867, it lasted only three years.  As Hine recounts, a hat merchant sued, claiming that it diverted customers to a rival and cast a shadow on his own shop.  A greater problem, though, was that crowds of pedestrians appropriated the bridge as a vantage point for viewing the urban spectacle, and as a spot to pose for photographic portraits.  Such uses reveal that Broadway’s chief attraction was already its crowds.",7
8. The last state of the Herald Building. S.E. cor. Ann Street. [c. February 1895],"In 1867, James Gordon Bennett built a headquarters for his New York Herald on the former site of P.T. Barnum’s American Museum.  His son’s decision in 1892 to relocate uptown marked the beginning of the end for Newspaper Row.

In the interval between vacation and demolition, buildings were rented out by advertisers. Reformers objected to their billboards not only on aesthetic but also moral grounds, claiming they deceived passersby.  Here, “pepsin gum” purports to cure wooziness, a neologism for indigestion that the company trademarked in 1895. One critic singled out this ad as particularly “maddening,” “impertinent, and … thoroughly objectionable.”",8
9. St Paul’s from Park Row,"When Trinity constructed St. Paul’s in 1766 for parishioners who had moved uptown, Broadway extended only six blocks farther north.  The chapel originally faced the Hudson River; only after three years of “persistent demands” was the portico added to permit entry from Broadway.  By the time Hine photographed it, it was the city’s last surviving colonial church and its oldest public building still in use. Unlike other churches, it had powerful admirers who protected it from the wrecking ball.
Hine’s accompanying clipping offers a dubious explanation of why Park Row diverges from Broadway at an angle, unlike other streets in lower Manhattan.",9
10. [The Washington Elm],"The northern boundary of St. Paul’s churchyard – the city limits in the 1760s – was marked, according to Hine’s clipping, by a long line of elms.  By 1903, this was the sole survivor.
The disappearance of elms, and their replacement by narrower “street trees,” was beginning to trouble elites.  The final blow was the elm leaf beetle, which reached New York State by 1890.  The death of this elm in 1908 provoked special regret, given its association with George Washington, who worshipped at St. Paul’s during his sixteen-month stay, and was said to tie his horse to one of the elms. When this elm was felled, the legend was confirmed: the sexton’s saw struck a hitching ring.",10
